This directory is intended to generate a distribution of angles based on the sampling of angles used in PIMC for rotations. 

There is one file, named FILENAME, that essentially does the same thing as RotOnly integrator does, but for the specific case of 
N H2O's in a nanotube of length L, where N is 2 and L is 0.6 nm, making the distance between molecules 0.6 nm.

FILENAME starts with the H2O's oriented such that the rotation matrix that maps the SFF to the BFF is the identity matrix.

It then proposes new angles in such a way that the amount of times the simulation accepts the proposed angles divided by the total
number of proposed angles is roughly equal to 0.3 (i.e. excepts 30% of proposed steps).

There is hope that the stripped down version of this code will generate the same distribution as what is generated in MoRiBS.
