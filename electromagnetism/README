chargedatagenerator.py        [1] number of charges                     For generating 2D files that store the position of charges making

                              [Note] may have more                      world physics, and sets derived formulae for lines of charge, rings
                              than one set of these                     of charge and plates of charge along with combinations.

path.py                       [1] GEOMETRYfile                          Determines the path of a test charge over a set of time steps whose
